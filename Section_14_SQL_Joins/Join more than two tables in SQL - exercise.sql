/* you are trying to join the titles table with the dept_manager table on from_date:

This is wrong because the two respective columns have entirely different meaning.
What you should have done is join the dept_manager table with the employees table on
the one thing that is common between them - the emp_no and this is the correct solution:

employees e
    JOIN
dept_manager m ON e.emp_no = m.emp_no

-- First solution:
SELECT
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,

WHERE t.title = 'Manager'
ORDER BY e.emp_no
;
/* So, you join employees, dept_manager, and departments (altogether) on titles on from_date,
as you will need a from_date from the dept_manager table, however you will also require to
join ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no (which are the employee numbers of the managers, actually, since
you have already joined employees and dept_manager) to make sure you extract those rows from
titles that contain these employee numbers precisely.
